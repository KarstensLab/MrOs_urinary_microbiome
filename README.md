We examined the urinary microbiome in older community-dwelling men in a paper titled **BMI and BPH correlate with urinary microbiome diversity and lower urinary tract symptoms in men** located on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.14.571758v1)

Here we have our code from the analysis of the urinary microbiome of 500 men from the Osteoporetic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS). We utilized 16S rRNA gene sequencing information from voided urine samples paired with clinical characteristics such as the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), BMI, age,  medical history related to prostate health, among others. We carried out the analysis primarily using R (version 4.3.1).
